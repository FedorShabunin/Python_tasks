This program calculates trajectory of particle in electromagnetic field using Boris algorithm. Radiation force can be enabled or disabled.

xy_trajectory - it is a trajectory of a particle in xy plane in constant magnetic field in z direction with radiation force. Without radiation force we get circle.

y_impulse - it is a dependence of y component of momentum in time.

non_relativ - it is a spectral intensity in theta = pi/2 in non-relativistic case (p0x = 0.01)

relativ - it is a spectral intensity in theta = pi/2 in relativistic case (p0x = 1)
